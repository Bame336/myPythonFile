# File Handling and Error Management in Python

This project demonstrates how to read, modify, and write files using Python, with error handling for different scenarios. It includes functions for working with both text files and JSON files. The program ensures that errors such as file not found, I/O issues, and JSON decoding errors are handled gracefully.

## Features

- **Read a file**: The program reads a file's content.
- **Modify content**: The content is modified (e.g., converting to uppercase or adding a new key in JSON).
- **Write to a new file**: The modified content is written to a new file.
- **Error handling**: Handles errors like missing files or invalid file formats.
- **Interactive**: The program prompts the user for file names and displays the file's content or error messages.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- No external dependencies.

## File Structure

The project consists of two Python files:

1. `file_operations.py`: Contains functions to read, modify, and write files (both text and JSON).
2. `main.py`: The main entry point where the user interacts with the program.

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository** (if using Git):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/file-handling-python.git
   cd file-handling-python
